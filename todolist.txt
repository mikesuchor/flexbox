To do list:

Graphic Design
- Make FLEXBOX title look better
- Change color of background/boxes to be more cohesive?

V2
- Add cross browser support to CSS (autoprefixer.github.io or gulp?)
- Make the site responsive (fix some text, fix FLEXBOX title H1 size)
- Add a navigation bar
- Add highlights to code snippets on hover and add JS onclick events to add highlights and change the color of code snippets
- Change Display section code to display: inline-flex and replace CSS transition effect with JS
- Rewrite <p> code to explain each flex property better and include all property values as code snippets
- Add links to github, twitter, linkedin, and email in the footer
- Add a copyright symbol and rewrite the footer

V3
- Add a flyout box or code box on the side showing how the code works for code snippets with the JS onclick event
- Allow the user to write in the code box to change values manually and see the result in the flex containers

Maybe
- Add left/right arrows to each section to scroll left and right on mobile devices
- Add samples of projects using flexbox (navbars, photo sites, etc.)
